# CV & Cover Letter Generator - Design Document

## Project Overview
A web application that helps users generate tailored CVs and cover letters for specific job applications by connecting their LinkedIn profile or uploading an existing CV, then linking to a LinkedIn job posting. The application uses OpenAI's API to create optimized documents for the specific job opportunity.

## User Journey
1. User visits the website
2. User provides their professional information by either:
   - Connecting LinkedIn profile (using LinkedIn API)
   - Uploading an existing CV (PDF or DOCX)
3. User provides job details by:
   - Pasting LinkedIn job URL
   - Uploading job description
4. The application processes both inputs using OpenAI API
5. User receives tailored CV and cover letter optimized for the specific job
6. User can download the generated documents as PDF or DOCX

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js with React 
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Pages**:
  - Home/Landing page 
  - Profile input (LinkedIn/CV upload)
  - Job input
  - Results/Download page

### Backend
- **Framework**: Next.js API routes
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication
- **Storage**: Firebase Storage (for uploaded CVs and generated documents)
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore (user data and generation history)

### External APIs
- **OpenAI API**: For analyzing CV/LinkedIn profile and job posting to generate optimized documents
- **LinkedIn API**: For fetching user profile data
- **Document Processing**: pdf-lib for PDF manipulation, docx for Word document generation

## Data Flow
1. User authenticates (optional for basic use, required for saving history)
2. User data is collected (LinkedIn API or CV upload)
3. Job data is collected 
4. Both data sources are processed and sent to OpenAI API
5. Generated content is formatted into downloadable documents
6. Results are stored in Firebase (if user authenticated)

## Key Features
- LinkedIn profile import
- CV document upload and parsing
- Job description analysis
- AI-optimized CV generation
- AI-crafted cover letter generation
- Document download in multiple formats
- User history (for authenticated users)

## Technical Considerations
- **Privacy**: Secure handling of personal data
- **API Rate Limiting**: Managing OpenAI API cost and limits
- **Document Parsing**: Extracting structured data from uploaded CVs
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance

## Future Enhancements
- Multiple CV templates
- Cover letter customization options
- Saved job applications
- Premium features (additional formats, advanced optimization)
