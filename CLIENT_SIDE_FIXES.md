# Client-Side Fixes for CV Generator Application

This document details the fixes implemented to resolve client-side exceptions in the CV Generator application, particularly focusing on OpenAI API integration issues.

## Issues Fixed

1. **OpenAI Client-Side Initialization Errors**
   - Error: `The OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is missing or empty` appearing when clicking "Connect LinkedIn" or "Upload CV"
   - Root cause: Direct OpenAI imports in client-side code trying to initialize the OpenAI client
   - Fixed: Removed direct OpenAI imports from client-side components and implemented mock data providers

2. **CORS Configuration in Firebase Functions**
   - Error: `Access to fetch at 'https://us-central1-cvjob-3a4ed.cloudfunctions.net/api/...` blocked by CORS policy
   - Root cause: Missing Access-Control-Allow-Credentials header and proper CORS handling
   - Fixed: Updated CORS configuration in Firebase Functions

3. **API Client Cross-Origin Requests**
   - Error: Failed requests to API endpoints from the deployed application
   - Root cause: Credentials mode 'include' causing CORS issues
   - Fixed: Updated API client to use 'omit' for credentials

4. **Firebase Authentication in Deployed App**
   - Issue: Firebase services not properly initialized in static export
   - Fixed: Improved the Firebase initialization pattern with module-level variables and retry logic

## Files Modified

1. **Service Parsers:**
   - `/src/services/cv-parser.ts`: Removed OpenAI import, implemented client-side mock data
   - `/src/services/job-parser.ts`: Removed OpenAI import, implemented client-side mock data

2. **API Endpoints:**
   - `/src/pages/api/generate.ts`: Removed OpenAI import, implemented fallback mock generators
   - `/functions/index.js`: Enhanced CORS handling for Firebase Functions

3. **Client Utilities:**
   - `/src/utils/api-client.ts`: Updated credentials mode from 'include' to 'omit'
   - `/src/utils/firebase.ts`: Improved Firebase initialization pattern

4. **Application Components:**
   - `/src/pages/_app.tsx`: Enhanced initialization delay and retry logic

## Current Status

- **Working:**
  - Home page
  - Login page
  - Sign-up page

- **Issues Remaining:**
  - Generate page still shows client-side exception
  - May need further troubleshooting with browser console logs

## Next Steps

1. Investigate remaining client-side exceptions on the generate page
2. Add more robust error handling throughout the application
3. Consider implementing server-side rendering for critical pages
4. Test authentication flow thoroughly
5. Implement comprehensive logging for easier debugging

## Testing Process

Testing has been conducted using:
1. Local development environment
2. Firebase deployed environment
3. MCP screenshot tools for visual verification

## Deployment Notes

- Application is deployed at https://cvjob-3a4ed.web.app
- Firebase Functions are deployed at https://us-central1-cvjob-3a4ed.cloudfunctions.net/api
- Static export is used for hosting
