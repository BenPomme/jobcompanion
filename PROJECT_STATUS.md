## Next Steps

### Required for MVP

1. **Firebase Project Creation**
   - Create an actual Firebase project
   - Enable required services (Authentication, Firestore, Storage, Functions)
   - Set up proper environment variables with real credentials

2. **GitHub Repository**
   - Create a GitHub repository
   - Push initial codebase
   - Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD

3. **LinkedIn Integration**
   - Complete LinkedIn API integration
   - Test OAuth flow
   - Implement proper error handling

4. **Document Generation Testing**
   - Test PDF generation functionality
   - Test DOCX generation
   - Test with various CV formats and job descriptions

5. **User Experience**
   - Test user flows
   - Add responsive design optimizations
   - Test authentication flows

6. **Deployment**
   - Deploy to Firebase Hosting
   - Set up proper domains and SSL
   - Test security rules in production

### Future Enhancements

1. **Enhanced Templates**
   - Add multiple CV and cover letter templates
   - Allow customization of templates
   - Implement premium templates

2. **Analytics & Optimization**
   - Add document scoring against job descriptions
   - Implement keyword optimization suggestions
   - Add recruiter-friendly formatting

3. **User Dashboard**
   - Create a user dashboard for tracking documents
   - Allow organization of job applications
   - Implement document versioning

4. **Premium Features**
   - Set up subscription payment processing
   - Implement premium features
   - Add usage limitations for free tier

## How to Proceed

1. Execute the setup script (`./setup.sh`) to configure the project
2. Create a Firebase project and update the environment variables
3. Push the initial codebase to GitHub
4. Deploy the Firebase Functions and hosting
5. Test the entire workflow end-to-end
6. Deploy to production and obtain user feedback

## OpenAI Integration

We've implemented a secure approach for OpenAI API integration:

1. **Security**: API keys are stored only in Firebase environment variables
2. **Cost Optimization**: 
   - GPT-4o for document generation
   - GPT-3.5 Turbo for initial parsing
   - Caching and usage tracking
3. **Quality**: Tailored system prompts and temperature settings for high-quality outputs

## Roadmap Timeline

- **Week 1:** Finalize Firebase project setup and deployment
- **Week 2:** Complete end-to-end testing of core functionality
- **Week 3:** Polish UI/UX and implement user feedback
- **Week 4:** Launch MVP and gather initial user feedback
