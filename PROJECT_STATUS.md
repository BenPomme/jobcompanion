## Current Issues

### Critical Issues
1. **Generate Page Error**: The generate page still shows a client-side exception.
2. **Authentication Flow**: Some issues with authentication flow in the static export environment.

### Medium Issues
1. **Performance Optimization**: Load times could be improved.
2. **Error Handling**: Better error handling and user feedback needed.
3. **API Reliability**: Some API calls fail intermittently in the deployed environment.

### Minor Issues
1. **Documentation**: Some documentation needs updates.
2. **Accessibility**: Accessibility features need improvement.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. Debug remaining client-side exception on the generate page
2. Implement comprehensive error handling for API calls
3. Test authentication flow thoroughly in production environment

### Short-term Goals
2. Add better loading indicators
3. Add comprehensive input validation

### Medium-term Goals
1. Add more document template options
2. Implement user profile management
3. Add analytics for user interaction tracking

## Technical Debt

1. **Node.js Version**: Currently dependent on Node.js 18 which is nearing end-of-life
2. **Firebase Functions**: Using older version of firebase-functions package
3. **Testing**: Need to implement comprehensive test suite
4. **Error Handling**: Current error handling is minimal and needs improvement
5. **Mock Data**: Mock implementations need to be more robust
